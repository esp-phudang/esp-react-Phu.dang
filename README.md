# react-to-die

- Introduce about your project
  this project I build to teach myself about how to set up a react project without create-react-app
- How other people can run your project
- What you used in your project
    I use:
    - typescript
    - babel
    - sass
    - webpack
- What you have learned from every chapter
    - install prettier and Ctrl+P choose Format Document, then choose format document  with Prettier and set a shortcut for this extension
    - what is package-lock.json
    - setup sass
    - setup webpack to compile all module into a bundler
    - State and prop change will trigger re-rendering the component but dont clear the states
